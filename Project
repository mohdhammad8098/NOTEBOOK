This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
(3*4)+5
17
# Code to multiply and add numbers
a = 5
b = 10
result = a * b + a
result  
# Code to convert minutes to hours
def convert_minutes_to_hours(minutes):
    hours = minutes / 60
    return hours

minutes_input = 120  # Example input
hours_output = convert_minutes_to_hours(minutes_input)
hours_output  # This will output the equivalent hours
## Objectives
- Understand key data science programming languages.
- Identify important data science libraries and tools.
